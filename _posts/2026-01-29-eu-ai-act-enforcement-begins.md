After years of debate and drafting, the EU AI Act's enforcement phase has officially begun. Companies have been given fair warning. Now comes the hard part.

## The Risk-Based Framework

The Act categorizes AI systems into risk tiers:

**Unacceptable Risk** (banned outright):
- Social scoring systems
- Real-time biometric surveillance in public spaces
- Manipulative AI targeting vulnerable groups

**High Risk** (strict requirements):
- AI in hiring and employment decisions
- Credit scoring and financial services
- Educational assessment systems
- Critical infrastructure management

**Limited Risk** (transparency obligations):
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Emotion recognition systems
- Deep fake generators

## Immediate Compliance Requirements

Companies deploying high-risk AI must now demonstrate:

- Robust risk assessment and mitigation procedures
- Human oversight mechanisms
- Detailed technical documentation
- Data governance practices that ensure training data quality

## Penalties Are Substantial

Violations can result in fines up to 7% of global annual revenue or 35 million euros, whichever is higher. For major tech companies, that translates to billions.

## The Global Ripple Effect

The EU's regulatory reach extends beyond its borders. Any company serving EU customers must comply, effectively making this a global standard. Similar frameworks are now being discussed in the UK, Canada, and Australia.

## Practical Advice

Start with an audit. Map every AI system your organization uses against the risk categories. For anything that might qualify as high-risk, begin documentation now. The regulators have made clear that good-faith compliance efforts will be viewed favorably.
