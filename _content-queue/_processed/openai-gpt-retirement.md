Key points to cover:

- Specific retirement date: February 13, 2026
- Which models are being deprecated (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 variants)
- Migration path recommendations from OpenAI
- Impact on production applications
- Cost implications of moving to newer models
- API compatibility considerations
- Timeline for graceful migration

Developer concerns to address:

- What happens to existing API calls after the cutoff?
- Are there breaking changes in replacement models?
- Performance/capability differences between old and new models
- Pricing changes developers should expect

This is urgent news that affects thousands of developers and companies with production deployments.

Heres their article:

On February 13, 2026, alongside the previously announced retirement⁠ of GPT‑5 (Instant and Thinking), we will retire GPT‑4o, GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini from ChatGPT. In the API, there are no changes at this time.

While this announcement applies to several older models, GPT‑4o deserves special context.

After we first deprecated it and later restored access during the GPT‑5 release, we learned more about how people actually use it day to day. We brought GPT‑4o back after hearing clear feedback from a subset of Plus and Pro users, who told us they needed more time to transition key use cases, like creative ideation, and that they preferred GPT‑4o’s conversational style and warmth.

That feedback directly shaped GPT‑5.1 and GPT‑5.2, with improvements to personality, stronger support for creative ideation, and more ways to customize how ChatGPT responds⁠(opens in a new window). You can choose from base styles and tones like Friendly, and controls for things like warmth and enthusiasm. Our goal is to give people more control and customization over how ChatGPT feels to use—not just what it can do.

We’re announcing the upcoming retirement of GPT‑4o today because these improvements are now in place, and because the vast majority of usage has shifted to GPT‑5.2, with only 0.1% of users still choosing GPT‑4o each day.

More broadly, we’re continuing to improve ChatGPT across areas users have told us need work. This includes further improvements to personality and creativity, as well as addressing unnecessary refusals and overly cautious or preachy responses, with updates coming soon. We’re continuing to make progress toward a version of ChatGPT designed for adults over 18, grounded in the principle of treating adults like adults, and expanding user choice and freedom within appropriate safeguards. To support this, we’ve rolled out age prediction⁠(opens in a new window) for users under 18 in most markets.

Changes like this take time to adjust to, and we’ll always be clear about what’s changing and when. We know that losing access to GPT‑4o will feel frustrating for some users, and we didn’t make this decision lightly. Retiring models is never easy, but it allows us to focus on improving the models most people use today.

FAQ
What happens to my conversations I have with GPT-4o or other deprecated models?
Conversations will default to GPT-5.2 going forward.

What happens to my projects?
Existing projects and conversations using GPT-4o or other models listed will remain as they are until February 13, 2026. Chats can be continued using other models after February 13, 2026.

What happens to my GPTs?
Existing GPT conversations are unaffected until February 13, 2026. On that date, the GPT’s default model will be updated to GPT-5.2, and new messages will use GPT-5.2.

Will voice mode still run on GPT-4o?
ChatGPT Voice is not changing as part of this update. While voice uses a similar base model as GPT-4o, it’s ultimately a different model from the text GPT-4o model being retired.

Will ChatGPT Images still run on GPT-4o?
ChatGPT Images is not changing as part of this update. While image generation uses a similar base model as GPT-4o, it’s ultimately a different model from the text GPT-4o model being retired.
