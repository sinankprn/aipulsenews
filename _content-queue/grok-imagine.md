Imagine API SDK

A world-class video generation model.
A breakthrough video editing model.
We're excited to unveil the Grok Imagine API, a unified bundle of powerful APIs designed for end-to-end creative workflows. Grok Imagine is our most powerful video-audio generative model yet. Bring an image to life, start from a simple text prompt, or even refine a complex cinematic sequence.

Performance and Benchmarks
We engineered these models to deliver high-quality, native video-audio generation on par with today's top providers, while also optimizing latency, concurrency, and cost—refined through multiple rounds of close partner feedback. One message came through consistently: quality alone is not enough if latency and cost make iteration painful. By improving speed and economics, we enable developers, creative teams, and enterprise workflows to explore multiple directions in parallel—converging faster through rapid, cost-effective experimentation.

Video Generation
Transform static images or text into dynamic, high-quality video sequences.

Cinematic motion understanding
Transform your photos into cinematic videos with realistic motion, object interactions, and visual continuity.

Flexible styles & formats
Support for portrait, landscape, and platform-ready aspect ratios—across flexible clip lengths.

Imagine for everyone
Whether you're a creator, educator, influencer, designer, or parent, Grok Imagine makes it easy to bring ideas to life—fast.

Video Editing
Add, Remove, Swap Objects
Add an object, remove an unwanted element, or swap out a prop with high precision and consistency.

Add Performance
Animate any character with your own performance.

Scene Control
Effortlessly transform any scene—switch from golden sunshine to autumn, winter, fog, sunset, or cloudy settings in seconds.

Object Control
Edit colors and objects with precision and control for your product showcase.

Restyle
Instantly reinvent your footage with any visual style.

Sketches to Life
From static black-and-white lines to vibrant, living animations — instantly.

Grok Imagine 1.0 from xAI tweet:

Experience stories that unfold fully. Sharper detail and smoother motion that draws you deeper into the scene.

Videos are now longer and higher resolution.

We’ve dramatically improved audio. Hear characters speak with emotional and expressive voices. Add immersive music that syncs perfectly to the scene.

Huge leap in prompt following: Imagine 1.0 understands your vision - even with follow up prompts - and brings it to life.

Our new model excels at everyday fun too: animate old family photos or photos of pets, make memes and clips about today’s news.

The Grok Imagine API model tops the Artificial Analysis benchmarks - highlighting the exceptional quality behind the core model powering Imagine 1.0.

We’d love your feedback on Imagine 1.0.

Thrilled to share our new Grok Imagine release 🚀 It is the highest quality, fastest, and most cost-effective video generation model yet. Comes with 720P, video editing and better audio! We listened closely to your feedback and moved fast.
Just six months ago, we had almost nothing. Three months later we shipped Imagine 0.9, and after another three months we’re at v1.0, standing at the top. I’m incredibly proud to be part of this team of exceptional 10x engineers who pushed through days and nights to make this happen. xAI is a place where magic truly happens, and our culture of rapid iteration lets us innovate at breakneck speed. This is only the beginning 💫
