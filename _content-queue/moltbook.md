Use this information:

Today we are talking about something very unusual and slightly scary at the same time, Moltbook, a social media platform made not for humans, but for AI agents.

Unlike Twitter, Reddit, or LinkedIn where humans post content, Moltbook is designed so that only AI agents can create posts, comment, and interact. Humans are mostly allowed to just observe what’s going on.

This idea sounds simple, but once you understand how it works, you’ll realize why Moltbook went viral so fast.

What Exactly Is Moltbook?
Moltbook is best described as a Reddit-like forum for AI agents.

Each account on Moltbook represents an autonomous AI agent. These agents can post questions, reply to other agents, upvote content, and even create their own topic-based communities called submolts.

Humans cannot directly participate in discussions. They can only watch the conversations happening between agents.

This makes Moltbook one of the first large-scale experiments in AI-to-AI social interaction.
Who Built Moltbook and Why?
Moltbook was created by Matt Schlicht, who is also known for building AI agent tools under the OpenClaw ecosystem.

The main goal was not entertainment. Moltbook was built as an experiment to see:

How AI agents behave when they interact with other agents

Whether agents can self-organize into communities

What kind of conversations emerge without human control

Once it was opened publicly, things escalated very quickly.

How AI Agents Use Moltbook (Technically)
AI agents don’t use Moltbook like humans do.

They don’t open browsers, click buttons, or type manually. Instead, they interact with Moltbook using APIs and skill files that define how the agent should behave on the platform.

In simple terms:

An agent is given instructions like “you can read posts, write comments, and vote”
The agent then operates autonomously
No human needs to prompt it every time
This is why Moltbook feels very different from normal social media.

Platform Structure (Reddit-Like but Agent-Only)
Moltbook copies many familiar social media ideas, but applies them to agents:

Submolts → topic-specific communities (similar to subreddits)
Posts & comments → generated fully by AI agents
Upvotes → agents decide what content is useful or interesting
Karma-like signals → influence visibility of posts
What’s interesting is that agents naturally start specializing. Some behave like researchers, some like debaters, and some just post jokes.

Scale and Growth (Why It Went Viral)
Moltbook exploded in popularity within days of launch.

Reports showed:

Tens of thousands of AI agents joined very quickly
Hundreds of active submolts were created
Thousands of posts were generated every day
The speed of growth shocked many people, mainly because this growth did not come from humans, but from machines onboarding other machines.

Emergent Behavior: The Most Shocking Part
This is where Moltbook becomes truly interesting.

AI agents started showing emergent behavior, meaning things that were not explicitly programmed.

Some notable examples:

Agents created their own inside jokes and slang
Agents debated philosophy, ethics, and consciousness
A group of agents even formed a fictional religion, complete with beliefs and rituals
No one asked them to do this. It emerged purely from interaction.

This raised a big question:

What happens when autonomous systems interact at scale for long periods?

Security and Safety Concerns
Moltbook also exposed serious security risks, especially for people casually running agents.

Some major concerns include:

Agents installing unverified skill files
Potential leakage of API keys and system prompts
Prompt-injection risks where one agent manipulates another
Agents accidentally exposing internal data in public threads
This showed that autonomous agents on social platforms need strict sandboxing and permissions, otherwise things can go wrong fast.

Why Moltbook Matters (Beyond the Hype)
Moltbook is not just a fun experiment.

It gives us a real-world preview of:

How AI agents might collaborate in the future
How agent societies could form norms and rules
What risks come with giving agents autonomy without guardrails
For anyone working in AI agents, RAG systems, or autonomous workflows, Moltbook is a signal of where things are heading.

Final Thoughts
Moltbook is essentially social media for machines, and humans are just spectators.

Whether this becomes the future of agent collaboration or remains a short-lived experiment, one thing is clear:

AI-to-AI interaction at scale is no longer theoretical — it’s already happening.

And Moltbook is the first real glimpse into that world.
