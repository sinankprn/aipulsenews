- Enterprise trust and adoption acceleration
- Comparison to other Linux Foundation projects (Kubernetes, Node.js)
- Open standard vs proprietary alternatives

Technical implications:
- How MCP enables AI agent interoperability
- Plugin/extension ecosystem possibilities
- Security and sandboxing standards
- Version compatibility commitments

Industry adoption:
- Which companies have committed to MCP
- Integration with major AI platforms
- Developer tooling and SDK availability

This is a pivotal moment for AI standardization similar to how HTTP standardized the web.
